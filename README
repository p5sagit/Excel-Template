Excel::Template is a layout system to use the data structure from HTML::Template
and create a Microsoft Excel file. A few caveats:
1) All limitations stated in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel are in force, as that is
   the module used for rendering.
2) The output() method is not extremely well-tested.
3) Not all the methods have been tested in all situations. I fully expect bugs
   to come back and have to be fixed.

Barring all of that, and a slight lack of features, it's a good module. Enjoy!
