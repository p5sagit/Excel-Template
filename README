Excel::Template is a layout system to use the data structure from HTML::Template
and create a Microsoft Excel file.

CAVEAT: All limitations stated in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel are in force, as that
is the module used for rendering. If the XLS file is corrupted, I would first
make sure you aren't doing anything that it says is bad.
